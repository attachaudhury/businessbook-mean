> A web/desktop erp built for nodejs (Node/Electron/Angualr/Express/Mongo).


I am making a open source erp for small and medium size businesses. New contributors are warmly encouraged


## Installation

OS X / Linux / Windows: clone the repo and run command in both folders frontend/backend

```sh
npm install
```


## Usage example

Project contains three folders. backend/frontend/theme . theme is just reference to ng-matero [https://github.com/ng-matero/ng-matero] used in this project. backend folder contains expressjs api. frontend contains electron/angualr app. After installing packages run these commands

In backend folder for starting backend express application run command
 ```sh
npm run local
```

In frontend folder for starting frontend angular application run command
 ```sh
ng serve
```

Or if you want to start a Electon Desktop instead of angular application run this command in frontend folder.
 ```sh
npm start:electron
```
